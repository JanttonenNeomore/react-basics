# Managing State - all about it:
Firstly checkout [state structure](https://react.dev/learn/reacting-to-input-with-state)
You should definetly checkout also [extracting state logic into reducer](https://react.dev/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer) and then [Reducers and Context](https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context)

EXP uses [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/why-use-react-redux) to handle updating and retrieving states
